I'm now the 4th year of undergrad and going to be a start for my graduate year this summer.

Last year, I dive into the learning of the **Reinforcement Learning**. From the beginning, just the shallow recognization, and now there will be a tough and complete studying period for me.

This page contains some notes during the studying. I try to combine the experienment coding and mathmatics, so I use the jupyter notebook to write.But the markdown can't be supplied very well for the text transformed from jupyter. So I transform them into PDF to present. Forgive me that the layout may be little mess. If you have any idea of any more convinient ways, please contact me!

**Notes list**

- 01 [Markov Decision Process and Dynamic Programming]('../files/MDP_and_DP.pdf')
- 02 [Monte Carlo Method and Temporial Difference]('../files/MC_and_TD.pdf')
